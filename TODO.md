## ðŸ“Š Current Architecture

### Data Model
- **Task**: Required project assignment, optional perspective, workspace-bound
- **Project**: Workspace-specific, default projects (hidden from UI)
- **Workspace**: Personal/Work/Hobby with configurable perspectives
- **Perspective**: Configurable views per workspace (Inbox, Next, Ideas, etc.)

### State Management
- Svelte stores with localStorage persistence
- URL-based state for bookmarkable views
- Derived stores for computed data (filtered tasks, counts)

### Component Structure
- `TaskList.svelte`: Main task display and actions
- `Sidebar.svelte`: Navigation, workspace switcher, perspectives
- `TaskItem.svelte`: Individual task rendering
- `NewTaskDialog.svelte`: Task creation modal

### Tech Stack
- SvelteKit + Svelte 5 (runes mode)
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Lucide icons
- TypeScript for type safety
- Local storage for persistence (mock backend)
