- **No backward compatibility needed**: The app is not released yet, so there's no need to maintain backward compatibility.
- **Remove legacy code**: Delete migration functions, fallbacks, and compatibility checks.
- **Fail fast**: Throw errors explicitly rather than silently falling back to default values.
- **Clean breaks**: When refactoring, make clean breaks without preserving old data structures.
