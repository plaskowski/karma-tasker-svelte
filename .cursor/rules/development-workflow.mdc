- **Commit after each edit**: Commit immediately with a descriptive message.
- **Do not ask to commit**: Never prompt the user about committing; commit automatically.
- **Conventional commits**: `type: description` (feat, fix, refactor, docs, style, test, chore, etc.).
- **Include benefits in messages**: Explain impact/benefits, not just what changed.
- **Test before committing**: Ensure no linter/type errors.
- **Resolve TODO flow**: Cross out the completed `TODO.md` item and move it to `RESOLVED.md` within the same main code commit (not a separate docs-only commit).
- **Squash rule**: When squashing, write a single updated message reflecting combined changes and benefits.
