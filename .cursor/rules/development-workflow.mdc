- **Commit after each edit**: Commit immediately with a descriptive message.
- **Do not ask to commit**: Never prompt the user about committing; commit automatically.
- **Conventional commits**: `type: description` (feat, fix, refactor, docs, style, test, chore, etc.).
- **Include benefits in messages**: Explain impact/benefits, not just what changed.
- **Test before committing**: Ensure no linter/type errors.
- **Resolve TODO flow**: Move the completed item to `RESOLVED.md` and remove it from `TODO.md` in the same main code commit (do not leave checked-off lines behind).
- **Squash rule**: When squashing, write a single updated message reflecting combined changes and benefits.
