- **Strict TypeScript**: No `any` in new code; prefer explicit types.
- **Svelte 5 runes**: Use `$state()`, `$derived()`, and `onclick` over deprecated patterns.
- **Clean imports**: Remove unused imports/exports after refactors.
- **Consistency**: Maintain naming, structure, and patterns across the codebase.
