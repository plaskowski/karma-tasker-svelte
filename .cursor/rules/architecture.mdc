- **Component separation**: Keep `TaskList` (container/logic) and `TaskItem` (presentation) separated.
- **Store management**: Use Svelte stores for global state; local component state for component-specific data.
- **GTD principles**: Align task organization with Getting Things Done.
- **MVP focus**: Keep features simple and essential; avoid unnecessary complexity.
