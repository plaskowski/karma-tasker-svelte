- **No tags**: Tags were removed for MVP; do not reintroduce without discussion.
- **GTD perspectives**: Use Inbox, Next, Waiting, Scheduled, Someday for categorization.
- **Mock data**: Development uses mock data with simulated delays/failures.
- **SvelteKit + Tailwind**: Stick to the current stack; avoid new dependencies unless necessary.
