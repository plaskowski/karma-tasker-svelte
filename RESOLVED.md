# Karma Tasker - Resolved Features & Accomplishments

## âœ… Completed Features

### UI/UX Improvements
- [x] Use the editor for new task flow (inline at bottom of main panel)
- [x] Auto-scroll inline create editor into view when opened
- [x] Autofocus title input on create/edit
- [x] Global N/Cmd/Ctrl+N shortcut opens inline new task
- [x] Escape closes inline/create editor even when typing in inputs
- [x] Remove visual dividers between task groups for cleaner look
- [x] Increase group header font size from `text-sm` to `text-base`
- [x] Add consistent padding (`mb-6`) between task groups
- [x] Align header heights - both sidebar and task list use `py-4` (16px padding)

 - [x] Workspace dropdown rendered inline below header and spans full sidebar width
 - [x] Removed numbers from "Views" header in sidebar
 - [x] Editor caret spacing fixed with custom chevrons on selects
 - [x] Checklist bullet and project badge aligned with title baseline; decorative dot removed
 - [x] Escape key closes inline editor
 - [x] Disabled animations for task rows and inline editor show/hide (instant)
 - [x] Cmd/Ctrl+Enter submits task editor (faster keyboard flow)

### Workspace System
- [x] Implement workspace architecture (Personal, Work, Hobby)
- [x] Add workspace switcher with dropdown in sidebar header
- [x] Workspace URL persistence (`?workspace=personal`)
- [x] Workspace-specific task and project filtering
- [x] Data migration for existing tasks to workspace system
- [x] Sample data population for Work and Hobby workspaces
- [x] Reset functionality for development (`Refresh` button)

### Project System Refinement
- [x] Require all tasks to have a project assignment
- [x] Default projects per workspace (hidden from projects list)
- [x] Workspace-specific project filtering
- [x] Auto-assign new tasks to workspace default project

### Flexible Perspective System
- [x] Configurable perspectives per workspace
- [x] GTD-aligned inbox concept (tasks without perspective = unprocessed)
- [x] Dynamic perspective rendering in sidebar
- [x] Perspective-based task filtering
- [x] Icon support for perspectives

### Navigation & State Management
- [x] URL state persistence (workspace, view, project)
- [x] Smart workspace switching (redirect from project view to inbox)
- [x] View preservation during workspace changes
- [x] Prevent broken navigation states

### Code Cleanup
- [x] Remove search functionality and UI
- [x] Remove settings functionality and UI  
- [x] Clean up unused imports and code
- [x] Simplified component interfaces

### Branding & Polish
- [x] Styled "N" badge with gradient background
- [x] Integrated workspace switcher into header line
- [x] Context-aware header titles (workspace/project names)
- [x] Consistent icon usage throughout app

### Design System & Components
- [x] Integrate Skeleton UI components for accessibility and theming
- [x] Configure Skeleton in Tailwind setup
- [x] Replace NewTaskDialog with Skeleton Modal (ARIA, keyboard support)
- [x] Migrate custom Tailwind styling to Skeleton design system
- [x] Implement built-in dark/light theme switching
- [x] Add keyboard navigation support across the app
- [x] Upgrade buttons, forms, and inputs to Skeleton components
- Benefits: Improved accessibility (ARIA, screen readers), consistent design system, easier theming

## ðŸ“Š Implementation Summary

### Major Architectural Changes
- **Multi-workspace support** with Personal, Work, and Hobby contexts
- **Required project assignment** for all tasks with default hidden projects
- **Configurable perspective system** per workspace following GTD principles
- **URL-based state persistence** for bookmarkable views and navigation
- **Data migration system** for backward compatibility

### Development Process
- **Iterative refinement** based on user feedback and real-world usage
- **Clean code practices** with TypeScript strict typing and component separation
- **Git workflow** with conventional commits and descriptive messages
- **User-centric design** focusing on simplicity and productivity

### Technical Achievements
- **Svelte 5 runes mode** implementation with modern reactive patterns
- **Derived stores** for efficient computed state management
- **Component composition** with clear separation of concerns
- **Error handling** and graceful fallbacks for data consistency
