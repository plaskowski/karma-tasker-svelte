# Karma Tasker - Resolved Features & Accomplishments

## âœ… Completed Features

### UI/UX Improvements
- [x] Remove visual dividers between task groups for cleaner look
- [x] Increase group header font size from `text-sm` to `text-base`
- [x] Add consistent padding (`mb-6`) between task groups
- [x] Align header heights - both sidebar and task list use `py-4` (16px padding)

### Workspace System
- [x] Implement workspace architecture (Personal, Work, Hobby)
- [x] Add workspace switcher with dropdown in sidebar header
- [x] Workspace URL persistence (`?workspace=personal`)
- [x] Workspace-specific task and project filtering
- [x] Data migration for existing tasks to workspace system
- [x] Sample data population for Work and Hobby workspaces
- [x] Reset functionality for development (`Refresh` button)

### Project System Refinement
- [x] Require all tasks to have a project assignment
- [x] Default projects per workspace (hidden from projects list)
- [x] Workspace-specific project filtering
- [x] Auto-assign new tasks to workspace default project

### Flexible Perspective System
- [x] Configurable perspectives per workspace
- [x] GTD-aligned inbox concept (tasks without perspective = unprocessed)
- [x] Dynamic perspective rendering in sidebar
- [x] Perspective-based task filtering
- [x] Icon support for perspectives

### Navigation & State Management
- [x] URL state persistence (workspace, view, project)
- [x] Smart workspace switching (redirect from project view to inbox)
- [x] View preservation during workspace changes
- [x] Prevent broken navigation states

### Code Cleanup
- [x] Remove search functionality and UI
- [x] Remove settings functionality and UI  
- [x] Clean up unused imports and code
- [x] Simplified component interfaces

### Branding & Polish
- [x] Styled "N" badge with gradient background
- [x] Integrated workspace switcher into header line
- [x] Context-aware header titles (workspace/project names)
- [x] Consistent icon usage throughout app

## ðŸ“Š Implementation Summary

### Major Architectural Changes
- **Multi-workspace support** with Personal, Work, and Hobby contexts
