## ðŸ“Š Implementation Summary

### Major Architectural Changes
- **Multi-workspace support** with Personal, Work, and Hobby contexts
- **Required project assignment** for all tasks with default hidden projects
- **Configurable perspective system** per workspace following GTD principles
- **URL-based state persistence** for bookmarkable views and navigation
- **Data migration system** for backward compatibility

### Development Process
- **Iterative refinement** based on user feedback and real-world usage
- **Clean code practices** with TypeScript strict typing and component separation
- **Git workflow** with conventional commits and descriptive messages
- **User-centric design** focusing on simplicity and productivity

### Technical Achievements
- **Svelte 5 runes mode** implementation with modern reactive patterns
- **Derived stores** for efficient computed state management
- **Component composition** with clear separation of concerns
- **Error handling** and graceful fallbacks for data consistency

### Data Loading Architecture (Partial)
- [x] load() function reads from persistence API - The load() function now reads directly from db.getWorkspaces(), db.getTasks(), db.getProjects()
- [x] Data flows from persistence API to load() to components - Components receive data as props from the load function
- [x] Removed navigation and workspace store dependencies - Navigation is URL-driven, workspace context passed as props

### Canon Migration Follow-ups (Completed)
- [x] prepareTaskForCreation#projectId and perspective are now required - no defaults needed
- [x] filterTasksByNavigation removed - unused function, filtering happens in derived store
- [x] task.projectId is now a required field in Task type
- [x] task.perspective is now a required field in Task type  
- [x] Refactored src/routes/+page.svelte - moved big functions to pageHandlers service
- [x] src/routes/+page.ts returns navigation data following SvelteKit patterns
- [x] URL navigation initialization moved to NavigationService.initializeNavigationFromURL
- [x] NavigationState fields use undefined (not empty strings) for missing values
- [x] ARCHITECTURAL: src/routes/+page.ts now loads all data for WorkspaceContext
  - Moved data loading from stores to +page.ts load function
  - Components receive data as props instead of directly subscribing to stores
  - Follows SvelteKit best practices for data flow and improved performance
- [x] Complete navigation refactoring to remove store dependency
  - Removed navigation store entirely
  - Navigation is now fully URL-driven through goto()
  - Single source of truth: URL parameters processed by load function
  - All navigation changes update URL, triggering data reload
- [x] Clean up workspaceContext implementation
  - Moved WorkspaceContext interface and implementation to lib/models
  - Removed currentWorkspace store and setCurrentWorkspace function
  - Workspace changes now use URL params with localStorage fallback
  - Removed all workspace-specific derived stores from taskStore
